# Coursera: Getting And Cleaning Data Course Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.
The R script, `run_analysis.R`, does the following:

1. Load the plyr library to be able to use the ddply() function
2. Clean up the workspace
3. Load and merge the training and test sets to create one data set
4. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
5. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
6. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names
7. Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each
   variable for each subject and activity pair.

The tidy data set is shown in the file 'tidyDataSet.txt`.
